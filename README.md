- 👋 Hi, I’m @d-rideout
- In the context of this GitHub profile, I’m interested in two things:
  - 🌱 (Thinking | Learning) about (thinking | learning)
  - 🌱 Time, by which I mean all things to do with temporal and logical ordering <!-- (and note that 'orderings' are often linear ('complete'/'total'), but not always)-->
- :game_die: I feel that the value of games to learning and research is substantially underappreciated.
- :musical_keyboard: I’m currently learning Python, with an eye towards:
  - understanding the motivations behind coding conventions
  - strategies for OOP design
- 💞️ I am open to collaboration on most projects hosted here.  Post a comment if you are interested.

> I believe that humanity shall accept as an axiom for its conduct the
principle for which I have laid down my life: the right to investigate. It is
the credo of free men this opportunity to try, this privilege to err, this
courage to experiment anew. We scientists of the human spirit shall
experiment, experiment, ever experiment.
**-- Roger Bacon (c.1214 – c.1294)**

> Science is a dialogue between mankind and nature....
But what makes this dialogue possible?
A time-reversible world would also be an unknowable world.
Knowledge presupposes that the world affects us and our instruments,
that there is an interaction between the knower and the known,
and that this interaction creates a difference between past and future.
Becoming is the sine qua non of science, and indeed, of knowledge itself.
**-- Ilya Prigogine** (quoted in Jan-Kyrre Berg Olsen's PhD thesis 2002)

> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge
**-- Proverbs 1:7**
