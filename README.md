- 👋 Hi, I’m @d-rideout
- In the context of this GitHub profile, I’m interested in two things:
  - 🌱 (Thinking | Learning) about (thinking | learning)
  - 🌱 Time, by which I mean all things to do with temporal ordering <!-- (and note that 'orderings' are often linear ('complete'/'total'), but not always)-->
- :musical_keyboard: I’m currently learning Python, with an eye towards:
  - understanding the motivations behind coding conventions
  - strategies for OOP design
- 💞️ I am open to collaboration on most projects hosted here.  Post a comment if you are interested.
<!-- - 📫 How to reach me ... 👀 -->
